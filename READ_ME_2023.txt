A couple notes on this code:
1) lines 246-270 (currently) contain three blocks that can be uncommented to reorder coupling files (ie, change diabats to be labeled as lowest energies) as well as to delete triads from either energy file (if desired, ie, if you want to plot the energy curves using the Mathematica code)
2) I wanted to make one note on the triad method. YVal_L (left point) is defined using sNb, the fixed value based on the number of bound states. Sbc is then used for the center and right points, but sbc is based on the R(iR) not RRight, and is not redefined for the right-point. I believe we talked about this being negligible because sbc is essentially the same regardless of whether or not it is redefined, and RRight vs. R(iR) play a role in the calculations of RVal_L and RVal_R. But, it does seem that maybe it should be redefined based on RRight anyways, and since I could not remember *exactly*, I thought I would point it out as something to consider or look at again.
3) If the diabatization is not working, you can run the code at whatever resolution you want once, and then re-run with the "troubleshooting" flag on. The troubleshooting flag allows you to just read in the raw energies and use the avoided_crossings subroutine on those energies. This means you can make edits on the subroutine and see the effects of your edits in seconds rather than running the entire code every time (hours).
4) You can use the following command to look at the energies without having to adjust xmgrace graph every time: xmgrace -nxy energiesv1.dat -p grace_energies.par &
